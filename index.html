        <h1>Why Environmental Awareness is important!</h1>
        <h3 class="contents">
          Environmental awareness means exactly what you may think: an awareness
          around the natural environment and the choices that either promote its
          well-being or cause it more harm. It is also the awareness that the
          earth is in need of protection for its survival. Along with this, the
          term “environmentalism” is an ideology that humans are responsible to
          protect and preserve the environment from human-caused afflictions. As
          previously stated, human-made choices are the number one reason why
          the planet is becoming sicker every day. Environmentalism on a large
          scale is one of the best ways to combat the devastating consequences
          of these human decisions and help the planet’s health take a complete
          180 degree in the other direction.

        <h1>Major Environmental Problems</h1>
        <h3 id="EnvironmentalIssues" class="contents">
          Some environmental life species require substantial areas to help
          provide food, living space, and other different assets. These
          creatures are called area specific. At the point when the biome is
          divided, the vast patches of living space don’t exist anymore. It
          becomes more troublesome for the wildlife to get the assets they need
          in order to survive. The environment goes on, even though the animals
          and plant life are not there to help sustain it properly.

            <p>
              A more basic cause of environmental degradation is land damage.
              Numerous weedy plant species, for example, garlic & mustard, are
              both foreign and obtrusive. A rupture in the environmental
              surroundings provides for them a chance to start growing and
              spreading. These plants can assume control over nature,
              eliminating the local greenery. The result is a territory with a
              solitary predominant plant which doesn’t give satisfactory food
              assets to all the environmental life. Thus the whole environment
              can be destroyed because of these invasive species.

            <p>
              Pollution, in whatever form, whether it is air, water, land or
              noise is harmful to the environment. Air pollution pollutes the
              air that we breathe, which causes health issues. Water pollution
              degrades the quality of water that we use for drinking purposes.
              Land pollution results in the degradation of the earth’s surface
              as a result of human activities. Noise pollution can cause
              irreparable damage to our ears when exposed to continuous large
              sounds like honking of vehicles on a busy road or machines
              producing large noise in a factory or a mill.

            <p>
              Rapid population growth puts strain on natural resources, which
              results in the degradation of our environment. Mortality rate has
              gone down due to better medical facilities, which has resulted in
              an increased lifespan. More population simply means more demand
              for food, clothes and shelter. You need more space to grow food
              and provide homes to millions of people. This results in
              deforestation, which is another factor in environmental
              degradation.

              Climate change is a great concern in today’s scenario. This
              problem has surfaced in the last few decades. Greenhouse gases are
              the major cause of climate change. Environmental changes have
              several destructive impacts such as the melting of glaciers,
              change in seasons, epidemics, etc.

          <div>
            <p>
              Deforestation is the cutting down of trees to make way for more
              homes and industries. Rapid growth in population and urban sprawl
              are two of the major causes of deforestation. Apart from that, the
              use of forest land for agriculture, animal grazing, harvest for
              fuelwood and logging are some of the other causes of
              deforestation. Deforestation contributes to global warming as
              decreased forest size puts carbon back into the environment.
